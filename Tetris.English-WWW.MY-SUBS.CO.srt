{\an8}[narrator] Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:55,556 --> 00:01:00,352
{\an8}you've already made the incredibly smart
decision to skip the casinos,

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,729
where the odds are stacked against you,

4
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,524
and come to the place
where you can't lose.

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,153
Technology is the future,
and video games are leading the charge.

6
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:15,742
So, step right up and be the first
to experience the world's next big hit.

7
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,246
Come try GO, Asia's favorite game.

8
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,124
Rights available everywhere except Japan.

9
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,168
How are you, sir?

10
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,670
GO, GO, GO. Come on.
Wanna play? It's like chess.

11
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,672
Except infinitely harder.

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,923
[clicks tongue]

13
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,758
[Henk] GO didn't go as planned.

14
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,386
I couldn't even keep my salesgirl
interested.

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,682
And I know how many excuses
bank managers hear every day.

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,685
But this is not an excuse.
This is an opportunity.

17
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:47,024
In fact, my little setback may have been
the best thing to ever happen to us.

18

-[chattering]
-Yeah.

19
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,234
-[Henk] Tracy.
-Yeah.

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,737
-[Tracy chuckles]
-Tracy. What are you doing?

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,947
How's it going?
I just invited this young lady over

22
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,408
to see how our new game
fares with the female audience.

23
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,744
-[Tracy chuckles]
-Uh-huh. Sure.

24
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,830
Come on, Tracy. I'm paying you
to sell my game, not play other people's.

25
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,374
Relax, Henk. This game is swell.

26
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,543
-What's it called?
-Tetris.

27
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,628
Tetris.

28
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,130
I don't get it.

29
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,842
It's a combination of tetra,
Greek for "four"--

30
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,138
all the game's pieces
are variants of four-- and tennis.

31
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,556
-Tennis?
-Tennis.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,935
Yeah, supposedly, the Russian inventor,
he, um-- he likes tennis.

00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:26,480

[chuckles] That's proprietary.

40
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,090
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen, Eddie.

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,508
Heard that line before.

42
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,095
No. It's nothing like GO.
It's in a completely different league.

43
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,263
Heard that line before.

44
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,265
Okay, fine. But, Eddie,

45
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,395
I played Tetris for five minutes, yeah.

46
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,941
I still see falling blocks in my dreams.

47
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,362
This game isn't just addictive.

48
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,030
It stays with you.

49
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,702
It's poetry. Art and math
all working in magical synchronicity.

50
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,786
It's…

51
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,415
It's the perfect game.

52
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,752
Why are you telling me this?

53
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,588
Do you have the video game rights?

54
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,884

on all platforms, worldwide.

55
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,719
Is Japan available?

56
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:44,183
Because you're looking
at the proud licensee of Tetris in Japan

57

-Correct.

00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,870
But, Eddie, this is different.

66
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,289
Tetris is already a hit.

-Russia.

00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,588
[Eddie] Henk, there is
no video games business in Russia.

[video game chimes]

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,350
[Henk] It all began with a guy named
Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov,

74
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,018
four years ago.

75
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,814
By day, he worked as a programmer
for the government

76
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,775
at the Soviet Computer Science Center.

77
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,443
[thunder rumbles]

78
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:40,781
[Henk] But by night,
he invented games for fun.

82
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,466
didn't even have a graphics card.

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,178
His falling blocks
were parentheses pushed together.

-[video game beeping]
-[typing]

85
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:10,060
[Henk] Alexey and a couple of buddies
from work made the game IBM-compatible.

00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,144
[cheering]

87
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,105
[Henk] Which meant color graphics,

88
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,901
8-bit music and floppy disks
that people copied and shared for free.

89
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,404
It spread like wildfire.

[video game beeps]

91
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:26,952
But this is the Soviet Union, remember?

92

Nothing gets out easily.

93
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,458
It would take an entrepreneur
to actually go there and monetize it.

94

Who?

95
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,795

179
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,136
Five hundred grand?

00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,847
Henk, let me get you that drink.

181
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,391

Are you out of your fucking mind?

184
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,482
I got a bigger vision, Eddie.

185
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,068
That is why I'm here.

186
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,699

-[translating continues]

192

We want you to make 200,000 cartridges.

00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,713
No.

208

[sighs] Had me worried for a bit.

209

-I need a check for three million dollars.
-[chokes]

210
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,139
That's the punch line?
You want a check from me?

211
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,101
And how did you get to three million?

212
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,564
{\an8}Because I'll need two million
for Nintendo cartridges

213
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,691
{\an8}and one million to make arcade machines.

214

{\an8}[video game beeps]

216

{\an8}Arcade is a cash business
and the money comes in fast,

00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,574
which is great for both of us.

00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,829
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
Eddie.

219
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,082
Nintendo is letting me become a publisher.

220
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,961
Nintendo. It's a license to print money.

221
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,925
-You feel that strongly about it?
-Yeah! Clearly.

222
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,802
-Then I'm upping your interest rates.
-Fine.

-And I want your house as collateral.
-Fine!

that house is ours.

You sure you don't have to talk
to your wife about this first?

how unimaginative these bankers are.

Is that a promise you can keep?

It was being played by government workers
across the Union for hours a day.

They were getting nothing done.

269

I-- It's Mr. Maxwell to you, sir.

287
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,290
I'm calling because I'm told
you bought PC, video game,

288
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,084
and arcade rights
for Tetris in Japan, yes?

289

That's right.

We signed a contract.

I've yet to sign mine.

351
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,698
[chuckles] Hello, Henk.

352
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,992
Minoru Arakawa,
President of Nintendo of America.

353
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,411
-I know. [chuckles]
-Henk Goddamn Rogers.

354
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,831
Welcome to Seattle. Howard Lincoln,
senior VP, chief legal counsel.

355
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,293
Your cowboy reputation precedes you.

356
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,462
Here. Sign this.

357
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,423
An NDA? Why?

358
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:37,177
Because only ten other people in the world
have seen what you're about to see,

359
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,305
and, to be honest, we don't trust you.

360
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,697
[Henk] 8-bit graphics?

361
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,743
Yes, and a brand-new
Sharp LR35902 core at 4.19 mega-hertz

362
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,871
with eight kilobytes internal RAM.

363
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,790
[gasp] Impressive.

364
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,710
No color screen?

365
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,671
Color, you'd need eight batteries
instead of four. It's too expensive.

366
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:17,634
This gives you 30 hours of game play,
all for $89.

367
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,802
[chuckles]

368
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,263
What's it called?

369
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,850
It's called the Game Boy.

370
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,770
Go ahead, try it.

371
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,028
[sighs]

372
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,285
[beeping]

373
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,411
[chuckles]

374
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,333
[beeping continues]

375
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,501
[chuckles]

376
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,544
We're launching in June.

377
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,547
And we want publishers like you
to be on the lookout for new games.

378
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,549
So, you'll package it with Mario?

379
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,468
Yes, it's our best brand.

380
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,431
-This game is programmed in C, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

381
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,475
How many pixels?

382
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,645
160 by 144. Why?

383
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,568
[typing]

384
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,657
[beeps]

385
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,204
It's not perfect, but you'll get the idea.

386
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,962
[video game beeping]

387
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,464
[chuckles]

388
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:41,176
Gentlemen, if you wanna sell a couple
hundred thousand Game Boys to little kids,

389
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,054
package them with Mario.

390
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:50,310
But if you wanna sell millions
of Game Boys to absolutely everyone,

391
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,604
young and old, around the world,

392
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,066
package them with Tetris.

393
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:03,699
Can you get us the rights?

394
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,493
[airplane whooshing]

395
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,164
[tires screech]

396
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,171
[chattering]

397
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,632
Hi.

398
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,760
My name's Henk Rogers.
I'm here to see Kevin Maxwell.

399
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,262
Do you have an appointment, sir?

400
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,472
Nope. It's a surprise.

401
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,683
-I'm doing my best.
-No, do not say that.

402
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,893
No, you're not doing your best.

403
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,478
No, it's--
In fact, on a scale from one to best,

404
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,023
you're doing less than zero,
which is fuck all!

405
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,108
The Soviets are not stupid.

406
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,402
They know that Tetris sells.

407
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,572
But they-- they're refusing
to engage with me on arcade rights

408
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:47,701
until I pay them for the royalties
I owe them on the computer games.

409
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,413
-And I can't pay them until you pay me.
-[knocks]

410
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,875
-Henk Rogers to see Kevin Maxwell.
-What the bloody hell is he doing here?

411
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,044
-Bring him in.
-Why?

412
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,505
-Well, I should go.
-Sit down.

413
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,133
We are a united front. Understood?

414
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,180
Mr. Rogers, what a pleasant surprise.

415
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,307
Robert Maxwell,
chairman of the Mirror Group.

416
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,809
Wow, hi.

417
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,687
-Uh, if I'm interrupting, I can--
-Not all all.

418
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:18,106
We were just talking Tetris actually.

419
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,109
This is Robert Stein
of Andromeda Software, and my son--

420
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,820
I can introduce myself, Father. Thank you.

421
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,030
Kevin Maxwell.

422
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,115
CEO of Mirrorsoft.

423
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,909
Mmm, I know. We met.

424
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,871
On the phone.
You sold my arcade rights to SEGA.

425
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,624
Well, it seems
everything's sorted itself out, yes?

426
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:41,922
[smacks lips] Before I forget,
this is for the Soviets, per my contract.

427
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,925
It's a game-play tape of Japanese Tetris.

428
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:50,848
Though we very much, uh, appreciate your,
um, personal delivery, Mr. Rogers,

429
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,684
but you could've mailed it.
You could've saved yourself the trip.

430
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:58,480
Uh, yes, but then I wouldn't be able
to talk to you about handheld Tetris.

431
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,857
Handheld?

432
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,608
[Henk] Mmm.

433
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,153
What I couldn't figure out
is who controls the rights.

434
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,197
You?

435
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,950
Without a doubt.

436
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,661
Yes.

437
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:17,207
Uh, Mr. Stein controls all the exclusive
worldwide licensing rights.

438
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:22,171
That's, uh, arcade, video game,
computer, and the handheld.

439
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:25,549
-We license everything through him.
-Fantastic.

440
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:30,846
Then I would like to buy
your worldwide handheld rights. Today.

441
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,515
Mr. Rogers,
Nintendo doesn't have a handheld device.

442
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,559
Why would they be trying
to buy into a market--

443
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,852
I can't comment on that,

444
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,355
but I am willing to make
a very generous offer on their behalf.

445
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,441
We'll consider your offer, Henk.

446
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,901
I can handle this, Father.

447
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,029
We'll consider your offer, Mr. Rogers.

448
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:49,323
I haven't made one yet.

449
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,241
Yes.

450
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,330
Have a splendid time in London.

451
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,296
See you around.

452
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,759
[whistles] You're excused, Mr. Stein.

453
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,720
And do not bother coming back here
without fully executed contracts,

454
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,556
including handheld Tetris, yes?

455
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,225
[groans]

456
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,692
We should give the Soviets some money.

457
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,612
They don't care about money, Son.

458
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,030
They care about loyalty.

459
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,657
Premier Gorbachev is my friend.

460
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,992
We're publishing his memoir. We're loyal.

461
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,037
Yes, um, Father,
um, the company's pension manager called

462
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,206
and said there was
a few million pounds missing

463
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,416
from the employees' retirement fund
last week.

464
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,545
Yes, uh, we had to rearrange
the balance sheets for the year-end.

465
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,797
-Small accounting quirk, is all.
-So, I shan't worry?

466
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,965
No, you shan't.

467
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:52,928
But, Kevin, we need Tetris, understood?

468
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,434
[door opens, closes]

469
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,108
-[siren wailing in distance]
-Mr. Stein.

470
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,110
Mr. Stein, please. Hold on.

471
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,279
What happened in there?

472
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,197
It's complicated.

473
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,241
Wh-- You don't control handheld rights?

474
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,869
I didn't say that.
I said it's complicated.

475
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,079
Either you do, or you don't.
What's so complicated--

476
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,707
Have you ever been in Moscow, Mr. Rogers?

477
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,750
Have you ever negotiated with the Soviets?

478
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,420
Do you know what it feels like
to be in a country where--

479
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,130
where everyone is watching you?

480
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:32,217
No. So, don't tell me what is
and what is not complicated.

481
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,513
I'll pay you $25,000 to secure me
worldwide handheld rights.

482
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,023
I guess it wasn't so complicated.

483
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,734
[airplane whooshes]

484
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,485
[tires screech]

485
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,404
[phone ringing]

486
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,412
-Hello.
-It's Howard Lincoln, Nintendo, America.

487
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:03,832
Listen, I just heard that Robert Stein

488
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:08,462
is selling handheld Tetris
to Atari for $100,000.

489
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,173
-What?
-Yeah, Atari.

490
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,675
You know how much
we hate those motherfuckers.

491
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,845
But now they supposedly have
a handheld device with our damn game.

492
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,014
I paid Stein to get me handheld rights.

493
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,098
What's happening?

494
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,185
Is Stein cutting you out
and getting the deal for himself?

495
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:26,438
I mean, if he is,
he's cutting out more than just me.

496
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,694
Are you selling handheld Tetris to Atari
behind my back?

497
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,655
-Kevin, good to see you.
-Do not call me Kevin!

498
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,989
We are not chums.

499
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:40,410
You deal with Mirrorsoft exclusively,
or have you forgotten your contract?

500
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:41,495
Oh.

501
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:45,958
Y-You mean the contract that gives me
global royalties on sales of Tetris?

502
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,210
-Uh, 'cause I-I haven't got any yet.
-[pants]

503
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,628
[exclaims] Okay! Okay.

504
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:55,467
I-I-I haven't secured handheld rights yet,
but, uh, j-j-just give me some time.

505
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,886
No,
I'll negotiate directly with the Russians.

506
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,847
We're through.

507
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:01,849
[glass shatters]

508
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:03,183
Through?

509
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,434
Through.

510
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,519
[door slams]

511
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,396
Screw it. I'm gonna go to Moscow.

512
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,399
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, you can't
just go to the Soviet Union, Henk.

513
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:13,902
You need a-- You need a business visa,
a full background check. It takes months.

514
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,821
Well, I'll get a tourist visa then.

515
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,116
So, you'll lie? That's a felony.
They could throw you in jail.

516
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,325
I'll take my chances.

517
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,660
Who you gonna talk to?

518
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,789
Some company called ELORG.

519
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,751
Companies don't exist in the USSR, Henk.
ELORG is probably KGB.

520
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,087
-Do you guys want this game or not?
-[Howard] Yeah, course we do.

521
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,173
But you're walking
into a communist country

522
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,301
that still considers America
enemy numero uno.

523
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,845
If you go, we can't protect you.

524
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,014
Okey dokey.

525
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,475
[in Japanese]
Where are you going now, papa?

526
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,603

-[in English] You're Danish?
-Huh? No. I'm Dutch.

530
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,245
Yet you sound American.

531
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,248
Well, I grew up in New York,
but I'm Dutch.

532
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,044
An-- And I live in Japan. [chuckles]

00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,540
Hi.

537
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,917
Henk Rogers, checking in.

538

[sighs]

539
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,797
I don't suppose you know
where I can find ELORG, do you?

540
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,967
Otherwise known as Electronorgtechnica.
It's a government body.

541
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,094
[clicks tongue] Government? Net.

542
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:06,431
[smacks lips] "No," as in you don't know,
or "no," as in you're not gonna--

543
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,820
[clerk, in Russian] We have a new guest…

544
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,201
[in English] ELORG.
You know, phone number?

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,876
-Translation services?
-No, thanks.

546
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,961

[person] Taxi!

551
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,939
[grocer, in Russian] No more fish or meat!

552
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:57,649
Please!

553
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,318
You must have some.

554
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,819
My family is hungry.

555
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,738
I have money.

556
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,620
Take this. Please.

557
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,038
No. You have a family too.

558
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,665
Please. My family will be fine.

559
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,666
Thank you.

560
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,632
[in English] Salutations.

561
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,052
You're in need of succor?

562
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,222
Excuse me?

563
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:33,185
Uh, succor. Noun.
Uh, assistance in times of stress.

564
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,479
Synonymous with help.

565
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,773
Sasha. Translation services.

566
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,399
Esteemed to meet you.

567
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,068
Oh. [chuckles]

568
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,444
[Sasha] Do you fancy history?

569
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:46,782
We can visit Stalin's Seven Sisters,
his palaces for the proletariat.

570
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,283
Or art?

571
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,327
We can go to the Pushkin Museum.

572
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,916
Actually,
where I really need to go is ELORG.

573
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,796
I assumed you were here
for vacationing purposes.

574
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,756
So you've heard of it?

00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:21,108
Mr. Rogers, this is not America.

578
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:25,821
Entering a government structure
without invite is highly illegal.

579
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:31,451
Sasha, I didn't travel 5,000 miles
to be stopped by a door.

00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,298
Yes?

584
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,258
Someone for you.

585
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,220
I'm listening.

586
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,932
[in English] Uh, yeah, hi. Henk Rogers.

587
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,395
Bullet-Proof Software.

588
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,360
[stammers] I publish the video game
version of Tetris in Japan,

589
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:08,405
and I'm here to license
the worldwide handheld rights from you.

590
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:09,907
[in Russian] What's that?

591
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,158
Hmm?

592
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,284
Where's it from?

593
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,287
[in English] I'm-- I'm sorry.
I-- I don't speak--

00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,126
Sorry, Sasha, but I really need you.

596
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,046

598
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,175
Uh, this is Sasha, my translator.

599
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,469
[in Russian] Hello, my name is Sasha.

600
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:31,845
I'm a translator.

601
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,765
[in English] Okay? Okay.

602
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,016
My name is Henk Rogers.

[translating in Russian]

604
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,895
And I publish Tetris

607
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,570
[in English] He inquires,
"What is Nintendo?"

608
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,948
Ha. Very funny.

609
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,370
Uh, Nintendo's the most popular
video game console in the world, sir.

612
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:06,296
[in English] He says ELORG never licensed
Tetris video game rights to anyone, ever.

00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,589
[Nikolai speaking Russian]

614
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,259
[in English]
Only the computer game version.

-No, that can't be true. Look, uh…

616
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:18,058

00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,233

621
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,696

-[in English] He denies obtaining a tape.

625
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,791
[in English]
And says that this is an illegal copy.

626
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,335
Mr. Rogers, I think we should vanish.

627
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,339
He thinks I stole Tetris?

628
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,924
Affirmative.

629
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:56,388
Uh, tell him I have my whole life
and then some invested in this game.

630
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,725
-He's-- He's mistaken.
-[translating continues]

631
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,646
[in Russian] I advise you to leave this
government institution.

632
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,065
Otherwise, as a foreign citizen
on a tourist visa,

633
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,860
you will be sent to prison
for fraud and trespassing.

634
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,238
[in English] He says he is not mistaken.

635
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,616
Is that-- Is that all he said?

636
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,327
Yes.

637
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:22,122
Sure. Okay, uh, tell him I'll fix this.

638
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:26,543
-We can figure out console…

00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,388
[in English] He says return in the morrow
at nine o'clock.

642
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:41,266
-But I must warn you--
-Okay. Okay, great. Thanks.

646
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:55,155
[in English]
I need an international pay phone.

647
00:35:55,948 --> 00:36:00,118
International pay phones
do not exist in Soviet Union, Henk.

648
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,870
But I need to call home.

649
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:03,956
You don't understand.

650
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,999
I convinced my wife to risk our home

651
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,751
so that I could afford
Tetris video game rights,

652
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,753
and now I'm being told I don't have them?

653
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:13,465
If I don't fix this, I'm fucked.

654
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,553
Your hotel has phone.

655
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,888
Okay, great. Let's go.

656
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:24,893
But you must wait in line as, uh,
only few wires leave our great nation.

657
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:26,186
But h-- how long?

658
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,731
Hmm, anywhere from eight hours to a week.

659
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:30,816
What?

660
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:36,196
Okay, but there's a fax machine
at the hotel, right?

661
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,284
Fax and telex
are in government buildings only, Henk.

662
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,579
Mr. Rogers, a word.

663
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:44,663
Please.

664
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,921
[door slams]

665
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,179
Do you know who I am?

666
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,307
I've got an idea.

667
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,100
Good.

668
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,104
I assume your translator told you

669
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:14,151
foreigners are not allowed in government
buildings without formal invitation.

670
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,070
Go home.

671
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,447
Understood?

672
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,249
[breathes shakily]

673
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,758
Mr. Maxwell, Valentin Trifonov,

674
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:41,094
Central Committee of the Communist Party,
Department of Foreign Trade.

675
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,679
Welcome to Russia.

676
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:45,057
My father told me to expect Gorbachev.

677
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:47,893
You're not Gorbachev.

678
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,187
And you're not your father.

679
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,482
You're here for Tetris, yes?

680
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,194
[sniffles]

681
00:37:57,277 --> 00:38:00,155
Let's see what we can arrange.

682
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,667
[people chattering]

683
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,835
Morning, Sasha.

684
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:16,046
Any chance I can cajole you
into changing your mind?

685
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,422
Not a chance.

686
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:20,843
[in Russian] Ready?

687
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,559
[speaking Russian]

688
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,853
[Sasha, in English]
Henk, this is Alexey Pajitnov,

689
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:33,272
the inventor of Tetris.

690
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,274
-Wow, really?
-Mr. Rogers…

691
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,650
[speaking Russian]

692
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:40,445
[in English] Henk, Mr. Belikov would like
you to know that he doesn't trust you.

693
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,781
[speaking Russian]

694
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:48,287
[in English] And you-- Sorry, these
are not my words-- are a liar and a thief.

695
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,374
I'm also a horrible cook.

696
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,376
[translating in Russian]

697
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,797
[in English] That was a joke.

698
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,758
-I don't think he understood.
-Yeah, I can see that.

699
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:02,926
[footsteps approaching]

700
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:05,762
[sighs]

701
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,599
[in Russian] Please, Mr Belikov continue.

702
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,770
[scoffs]

703
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,898
[in English]
I'm sorry, but who-- uh, who are you?

704
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,232
Please, sit.

705
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:25,991
The more important question here
is who are you, Henk Rogers?

706
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,580
Your visa says you're a tourist,
but you're not.

707
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,373
[sucks teeth] A crime.

708
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:37,878
Your Tetris game says you licensed it,
but you did not.

709
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,255
Well, another crime.

710
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,718
So, here's what I'm thinking.

711
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:51,934
You go home today, cease production
of Tetris, all will be forgiven.

712
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,270
Or you stay and face the consequences.

713
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,190
[smacks lips]

714
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,276
I-- I'm not going home without a deal.

715
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:03,654
Sorry.

716
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:07,783
"Sorry" will not work in our courts,
Mr. Rogers.

717
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,869
[in Russian] Mr Belikov…

718
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:28,846
[in English] Alexey.

719
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,058
I just wanna say
that your game is brilliant.

720
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,685
[translating in Russian]

721
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,770
[in English] Thank you. I speak English.

722
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,398
And I have so, so many questions.

723
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:43,026
But first, I want you to know that
when I clear up this misunderstanding,

724
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,821
and hopefully secure handheld rights,

725
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,949
I'm gonna make you a millionaire.

726
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,829
-Mr. Rogers.
-Please, call me Henk.

727
00:40:56,665 --> 00:41:02,671
Mr. Rogers, I do not have right
to receive money from my game.

728
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,298
Well, that-- that's criminal.

729
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,507
No.

730
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:07,718
It is communism.

731
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:12,681
[in Russian] If that idiot's a thief…

732
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,141
Jail him.

733
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,228
Are the other buyers here?

734
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,524
Keep them separated.

735
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:26,278
We are going to beat these capitalists
at their own game.

736
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:31,825
[Henk, in English] Mr. Belikov,

737
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:35,621
if I'm a thief, why would I come to Moscow
and proudly show you my game?

738
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,122
[Sasha translating in Russian]

739
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:42,711
[speaking Russian]

740
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,839
[in English]
Because you want handheld rights.

741
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:49,343
Yeah, but if I already stole
video game and arcade rights,

742
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,929
what would stop me from stealing handheld?

743
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,138
[translating continues]

744
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:57,100
[speaking Russian]

745
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,896
[in English] Mr. Belikov inquires
as to why you mention arcade rights.

746
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,565
Uh, I bought Japanese arcade rights too,

747
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:07,027
only to find out that Mirrorsoft
already licensed them to SEGA.

748
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,530
-[translating continues]
-[in English] Stop, stop, stop.

749
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:16,245
[speaking Russian]

750
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:20,457
[in English] ELORG never transacted
arcade rights to anyone, Henk.

751
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,419
Wa-- Wait, hold on.

752
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:28,882
So you're saying the only version
of Tetris you ever licensed

753
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:30,384
was for personal computers?

754
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,344
[translating continues]

755
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,347
Can I see the contract you signed?

756
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,224
[translating continues]

757
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:40,102
[in English] Please,
it'll help me understand what's going on.

758
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,311
[translating continues]

759
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,981
-'Cause I-- I don't know if you know…
-[translating continues]

760
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,858
…but Stein and Mirrorsoft are selling

761
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:51,029
Tetris video game
and arcade rights worldwide.

762
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:52,281
[translating continues]

763
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:01,957
[unzips]

764
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,513
Mr. Belikov?

765
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,100
I'm, uh, Robert Stein.

766
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:24,897
I'm here to shore up contracts
for arcade and handheld rights.

767
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,523
Uh, please, Mr. Stein. One minute.

768
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,150
Hmm? What?

769
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,279
Ah, Mr. Belikov.

770
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:34,072
Thank you very much for agreeing to meet.

771
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,282
[speaking Russian]

772
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,534
Mr. Belikov asks, "What is this?"

773
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:41,121
[smacks lips] Well, I suppose
it's Tetris for Nintendo in Japan.

774
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,957
But I'm here to discuss handheld rights,
not video, so…

775
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:48,670
[speaking Russian]

776
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,756
[translator, in English]
He asks if you authorized

777
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,300
the sale of Tetris video games
to Henk Rogers.

778
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,303
Mr. Belikov, I run one of the largest
media companies in Europe.

779
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,348
I don't have time to meddle
in the day-to-day aspects. [chuckles]

780
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,600
[speaking Russian]

781
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,228
[in English] So, you are saying
that you have never seen this game?

782
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,563
No, I'm saying that
we should move on to today's business.

783
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:08,607
[speaking Russian]

784
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,067
[in English] Do you think it's pirated?

785
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,735
I don't know, maybe?

786
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,154
Can we talk about handheld Tetris?

787
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,239
[speaking Russian]

788
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:16,698
[in English] Tomorrow, thank you.

789
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:17,866
Yeah.

790
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,327
Fucking commie bastards.

791
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,620
[inhales]

792
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:29,545
-Okay, I read the contract and I agree.
-[translating in Russian]

793
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:33,340
You never intentionally sold
video game rights to Robert Stein.

794
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,133
[translating continues]

795
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:37,553
-[Henk] But here's the thing…
-[translating continues]

796
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:41,265
[gasps]

797
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,477
-Okay, this is a Nintendo.
-[translating continues]

798
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,022
And this is a personal computer.

799
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:51,567
What's the difference?

800
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,987
No keyboard for Nintendo.

801
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,113
[video game beeps]

802
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,739
No keyboard for Ninte--

803
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,158
You speak English?

804
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,036
Of course you do.

805
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,329
Look, I'm sorry.

806
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:06,540
Robert Stein screwed you.

807
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:09,042
-But legally speaking…
-[taps desk]

808
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,880
…he didn't steal from you,
which means I didn't steal from you.

809
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:18,677
Next time, define computers so you can
hold on to your video game rights.

810
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,099
[clears throat]

811
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:28,562
And what about arcade?

812
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:31,106
There's nothing in that contract
about arcade rights.

813
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,359
That, Stein definitely stole from you.

814
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:36,612
How much are they worth?

815
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,489
$150,000.

816
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,079
Where does he keep running to?

817
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,956
Mr. Belikov.

818
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:50,459
Mr. Belikov.

819
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,418
[in Russian] No!

820
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,008
[in English] Alexey,
we got off on the wrong foot.

821
00:45:58,091 --> 00:45:59,760
Can I buy you dinner?

822
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:03,138
Mr. Rogers, I'm not for sale.

823
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:13,190
Is paragraph 40 a more prudent definition
of PC computer?

824
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,777
"Whereas PC computers
consist of processor,

825
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,362
monitor disk drive, and keyboard."

826
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:19,947
-Yeah, much better.
-Keyboard.

827
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,492
But Stein signed years ago.
What's the point of this?

828
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,746
Oh, no. Please. You're welcome.

829
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:28,956
Okay.

830
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,791
Okay. Wh-What is going on?

831
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:39,132
What is this?

832
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,300
New contract.

833
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:45,097
$150,000 for arcade rights? [chuckles]

834
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,015
Who the hell gave you these numbers?

835
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:50,227
Who gave SEGA the right
to sell Tetris arcade in Japan?

836
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:53,272
Hmm?

837
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:55,816
If--

838
00:46:56,567 --> 00:47:02,364
If I sign this contract,
then we can discuss handheld rights, yes?

839
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,996
I-I-I need a night to-- to-- to--
to read the contract. Hmm?

840
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,625
[speaking Russian]

841
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,588
[in English]
He says we are done for the day.

842
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,715
But we haven't discussed handheld yet.

843
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:20,757
[speaking Russian]

844
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:24,428
[in English] He says we will
gallantly attack that in the morrow.

845
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,638
[taps desk]

846
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:27,723
Okay.

847
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,143
Alexey.

848
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:33,353
You want a lift?

849
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:36,481
-I have car.
-Oh.

850
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:38,442
Can I get a lift, then?

851
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:47,284
So, where you from?

852
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,830
I'm from Holland,
but I grew up in New York.

853
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:56,376
My parents were Dutch
with some Jewish and Indonesian blood.

854
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,631
I'm basically Eddie Van Halen.

855
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:01,965
[laughs]

856
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,344
Mr. Rogers, I don't need small talk.

857
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:11,225
Look, believe it or not,
I honestly want to get to know you.

858
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:15,020
If not as a business partner,
then as a fan.

859
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,733
[gasps]
Come to my hotel for dinner tonight.

860
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:21,777
No.

861
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:24,780
[Henk] Then can I come to your house?

862
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:32,162
Having a foreigner in one's home
is crime here.

863
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:34,748
So…

864
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,461
just call.

865
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:40,838
[scribbling]

866
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:42,673
Great.

867
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:44,800
Thanks for the ride.

868
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,303
-Guess how long my meeting lasted?
-Two minutes and three seconds.

869
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,848
You, sir, need better manners.

870
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,351
[translator] You are saying
that you've never seen this game?

871
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,312
-[Kevin] I'm saying that we should move--
-[recording stops]

872
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:58,647
You are spying on me?

873
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:00,315
You bastard!

874
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:03,402
Careful, Kevin.

875
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:06,989
[sighs]

876
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:11,368
Let's take a walk outside. Yes?

877
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:36,685
[Valentin]
What are you offering for Tetris?

878
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:39,479
[Kevin groans] The exclusive publishing
rights to our Collier's Encycl--

879
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,107
No. How much money?

880
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:44,693
[sighs] The rights are worth
two million dollars.

881
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,570
So, you know, it's tit for tat.

882
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,738
Hmm.

883
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:48,947
More like tit for shit.

884
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:51,116
[snickers] Excuse me?

885
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:53,744
This is fucking Russia.

886
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:56,663
You people, you don't care about money.

887
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,541
[sighs]

888
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,377
-Where are you from, Mr. Maxwell?
-What's that got to do with it?

889
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:05,005
Me, I'm from Stavropol Krai.

890
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:09,843
My parents were kolkhoz,
you know, sharecroppers.

891
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,348
They worked 18 hours a day
on a state-owned farm.

892
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,767
-The government took everything.
-[sighs]

893
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:20,687
I realized very young that
if I was going to succeed in this society,

894
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,066
I would need this. Only this.

895
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,150
[scoffs]

896
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:28,737
And unlike you,
nobody helped me get to where I am today.

897
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,323
So, spare me the Bolshevik shit.

898
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,701
[sighs, smacks lips]

899
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:36,578
Communism is dying.

900
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,205
Soon I'll be out of a job.

901
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,751
Like you,
I want to walk away with the best deal.

902
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:45,963
You want me to bribe you? [gasps]

903
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,131
Is that what this is?

904
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:49,216
[scoffs]

905
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,803
-No, no. I run an honest company.
-[Valentin scoffs]

906
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:56,557
Nobody becomes a billionaire
by being honest, Mr. Maxwell.

907
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,393
And nobody becomes a billionaire
by trusting a dirty politico either.

908
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:03,438
If you are in search of a pawn,
I do suggest you fuck off.

909
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,024
Good day.

910
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:07,901
[bird cawing]

911
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:14,950
$100,000, US, when I get the deal.

912
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,201
No.

913
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,370
That is not what I'm asking.

914
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:20,038
[in Russian] Boris

915
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,456
Stop recording.

916
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,752
-[clicks]
-[in English] 800,000.

917
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,463
Half up-front, wired to a Swiss account.

918
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:32,467
300, paid when I get handheld Tetris.

919
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:34,845
Oh. Perhaps I'll ask Mr. Rogers.

920
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,597
Henk Rogers has no money.

921
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,600
He reps Nintendo,
and they'd never bribe you.

922
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:43,562
And Robert Stein is too cheap, so don't
even bother threatening me with him.

923
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:44,855
400.

924
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,231
Final offer.

925
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,484
Okay then.

926
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:51,195
And, Mr. Trifonov?

927
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:55,699
Kevin does not need to know
about any of this.

928
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,161

[shutter clicking]

932
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,434
[spouse, in Russian]
Why are we taking the risk?

933
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:24,561
Especially after
what happened to your father.

934
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,022
Have you ever tried to say no
to an American?

935
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:28,190
[knocks]

936
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:29,566
It's impossible.

937
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,369
[in English] Hello.

938
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:41,453
Hi.

939
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,997
That's Maya. She's ten.

940
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,542
Julie's eight.

941
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,211
Michael, six.

942
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,129
Leo's three.

943
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:53,340
And that is my wife, Akemi.

944
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,301
We met in college, in Hawaii,

945
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,888
fell in love,
and I followed her back to Tokyo.

946
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,266
You have lived many places.

947
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,560
Yeah, I guess so.

948
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:06,603
How about you?

949
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:08,605
Oh, I lived only here.

950
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:09,982
In Moscow?

951
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,775
In this apartment.

952
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:16,613
[slurps]

953
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:21,118
So, Henk, how do you like Moscow?

954
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,202
Honestly?

955
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:24,913
It's a bit confusing. [chuckles]

956
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:28,542
Russia is difficult country
to love at first.

957
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:32,212
Much like our literature,
it's cold and dark on the outside.

958
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:35,591
But also romantic and inspired. [chuckles]

959
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:37,801
Nobody sees that side anymore.

960
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:40,554
How did you find Tetris, Henk?

961
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:46,268
I was at the Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas, selling a game I had designed.

962
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,645
Then I saw your husband's game--

963
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,439
-And then you stole it.
-[Alexey] Nina.

964
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,858
No, it-- it's fine.

965
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:56,445
I licensed it from a big company
who lied to me.

966
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,782
But I'm here to make things right.

967
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,409
Because Tetris--

968
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:05,037
It's that good.

969
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,460
[in Russian] He's dumb. But he is honest.

970
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:18,550
[in English]
So you are a game designer, Henk?

971
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:21,094
Mmm. And a programmer.

972
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:24,348
Well, though I've mostly
been doing sales lately.

973
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:27,351
Pascal or assembler?

974
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,853
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
[chuckles]

975
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:31,813
Um, I like Pascal.

976
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,941
Assembler is my go-to.

977
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:35,150
But never underestimate…

978
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:36,944
[both] …the power of BASIC.

979
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:39,446
[chuckles]

980
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,908
That's spooky.

981
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,076

This is it?

984
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,792
The original?

00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,670
[computer beeping]

986
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,176

Yes.

[Henk] It's always been bugging me.

993
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:24,157
Why can't both lines disappear at once
instead of one at a time?

994
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:26,159
-Um, because, uh…

996
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,663
-…I never thought of that.
-[chuckles]

997
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,250
[Henk] We should allow up to four lines
to disappear at once.

998
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,210
We should?

999
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,462
What?

1000
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:38,964
Yeah.

1001
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:40,632

-[Alexey] Henk? Hmm.
-Right.

1005
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:56,523
Higher levels equals more points.
So, you'd--

1006
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:58,275
Sorry.

1007
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,451

-Close.

1008
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,578

-Sorry, Henk, you have to go.

Okay.

1026
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,976
-But only if you come with me.
-What?

1027
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,812
We should go out.
But not at some tourist bar.

1028
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,772
Show me the real Moscow,
where people like you hang out.

Henk, it is really not good idea. I'm--

00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:24,278
Ah, yeah. I know, but sometimes
you gotta say "fuck the rules," right?

-I mean, that's why I came to Moscow.

that's why you invited me here tonight.

Hmm. Love the music.

Look, personally, I-- I prefer, uh,
Mozart and, um, Russian folk songs.

To many, that is tantamount
to-- to treason.

It's just a video game.

To you, yes.

1117
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:11,500
But to the men in power
it is a slippery slope

from selling one game to selling
all of Russia to the highest bidder.

have him fax ELORG
my contract with Mirrorsoft,

1161
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:29,304
and have him draft up
a new contract for handheld Tetris.

Why is Henk Rogers here, hmm?

1174
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:23,192
Are you trying to, uh,
play us off against each other, hmm?

1175

'Cause if you're trying to screw with me,
I swear--

1176
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:28,655
Mr. Stein,
have you read your revised contract?

1177
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:30,032
Yes.

1178

Yes, I did. It-- It's not fair.

You-- You-- You charge
far too much for arcade rights.

1180
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:38,165
And why should I sign
a new contract for the PC rights

1181
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,417
that I already own fair and square, hmm?

1182

Oh, okay, okay. Huh?

1183
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:46,548
I'll-- I'll sign, but then we discuss
the handheld rights, yes?

1185
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,221
Okay, handheld. How much?

1186
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:54,223
-We'll come back.
-No.

1187
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:56,225
No, no. No!

1188
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:02,981
Mr. Belikov, with all due respect,
what the hell is going on?

1189
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,735
First, one of your cronies threatens me,

1190
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:09,696
then you threaten my wife in Japan,

1191
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,281
my hotel room gets trashed,

1192
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:14,368
and now I find out
you're negotiating with Robert Stein.

1193
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:16,370
After all he's done to you?

1194
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,455
This, this is insane.

1195
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,499
I am the only honest guy here!

1196
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,292
[in Russian] You're all swindlers.

1197
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:25,170
You're all here just for the money.

1198
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:27,756
[in English] What? I don't speak Russian.
I don't have my translator.

1199
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,299
And where's Alexey?

1200
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:32,177
You guys, you think that I'm the enemy?

1201
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,430
You're wrong.
This isn't about the money anymore.

1202
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:38,725
It's about giving Alexey his due
and showing the world

1203
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:42,479
the Soviet Union is about more
than just missiles and military might.

-[mumbling]
-What is that?

1208
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,538
Your contract with Mirrorsoft.

1209
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:02,833
Proving that I didn't steal from you.

1210
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,544
And behind that is my new offer.

1211
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:07,462
There are no numbers on it.

1212
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:15,512
$25,000, up-front, for worldwide handheld
rights, plus 25 cents per unit sold.

1213
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,555
$25,000?

1214
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:22,227
[laughs] Why so little?

1215
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,023
Because, to be honest,
I got no money left.

1216
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:30,944
But the royalties I'm offering
are more than fair.

1217
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:36,658
[Belikov sighs]

1218
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,245
How many games you expect to sell?

1219
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:43,457
Conservative estimate, a million.

1220
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:48,086
My estimate is 20 million.

1221
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,466
That means you get five million dollars.

1222
01:08:55,844 --> 01:09:00,140
Uh-- Oh, come on.
You guys are the kings of cliff-hangers!

1223
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:02,059
[Valentin speaking Russian]

1224
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:05,895
A word, please.

1225
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:11,151
I have been following your negotiations.

1226
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:13,694
You've done a masterful job.

1227
01:09:14,321 --> 01:09:18,367
It's all for the Soviet Union,
Comrade Trifonov.

1228
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:19,910
Good.

1229
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:24,247
Because the state has decided
that Tetris will go to Mirrorsoft.

1230
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:32,673
Good.

1231
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:34,341
Let's go.

1232
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:39,429
[in English] Ah, Mr. Be-- Oh, for fuck--

1233
01:09:39,513 --> 01:09:40,930
What's he doing here?

1234
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,184
Foreign Trade is my department,
Mr. Maxwell.

1235
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:45,727
[sighs] Okay.

1236
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,979
[clears throat] Mr. Belikov,

1237
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:50,274
Mirrorsoft is prepared to offer
the Russian publishing rights

1238
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:53,359
to its Collier's Encyclopedias,
worth two million dollars,

1239
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:56,029
in exchange for worldwide handheld Tetris.

1240
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,282
-And royalties?
-Oh, for Christ's sake, Mr. Belikov.

1241
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:00,200
I just offered you the deal of a lifetime.

1242
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,493
[clears throat]

1243
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:11,336
[sighs] We are prepared to give you deal,
Mr. Maxwell, but times…

1244
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,213
[chuckles] …times are changing.

1245
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:16,758
Uh, we are held accountable
for our decisions.

1246
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:20,095
You see, choosing the offer
with no real money looks

1247
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:21,972
suspicious.

1248
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:24,141
[scoffs]

1249
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,225
Okay.

1250
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:27,436
Fine, fine.

1251
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:30,022
All expenditures have to be approved
by my board, mind you.

1252
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:34,443
But, unofficially, I can offer ELORG
one million US dollars by the end of week.

1253
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:37,905
-And royalties?
-Ah, Jesus fucking Christ.

1254
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:38,864
[in Russian] That's enough.

1255
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:42,117
[in English] What did he say?

1256
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:44,578
[sighs]

1257
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,711
[Belikov] One million dollars…

1258
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:56,381
added to letter of intent.

1259
01:10:56,465 --> 01:11:00,260
We promise Mirrorsoft
worldwide handheld Tetris,

1260
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:03,555
if you wire us
one million dollars in one week.

1261
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,767
Well, gentlemen,

1262
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,394
looks like we, uh… [chuckles]

1263
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:10,812
…we have ourselves a deal.

1264
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:14,566
[Kevin grunts]

1265
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:17,110
Let me walk you out.

1266
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:18,862
-But we're not finished--
-Now!

1267
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:27,412
-Mr. Belikov, the exit is this way.
-Shut up.

1268
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:36,713
Is everything all right?

1269
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:41,301
You have one week to make an offer
for worldwide handheld rights.

1270
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:42,594
You have my offer.

1271
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,596
I'm ready to sign now. What is going on?

1272
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,474
You must sign a letter of intent first.
It's protocol.

1273
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:50,102
-Are you lying to me, Belikov?
-Listen.

1274
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:53,856
If you knew the risk I'm taking right now,
you wouldn't ask that.

1275
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:56,024
Please sign.

1276
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:57,693
Please.

1277
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,531
[shutter clicking]

1278
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:04,157
And one more thing.

1279
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:09,329
If you would like to make an offer
for worldwide video game rights,

1280
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:11,623
ELORG is open to deal.

1281
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:13,667
What?
Stein has the worldwide video game rights.

1282
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,751
No, he doesn't.

1283
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,005
I redefined "computer."

1284
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:23,218
Stein needed arcade rights,
so, he signed a new contract.

1285
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:25,762
Why are you helping me, Belikov?

1286
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:28,599
I'm doing what is the best for my country.

1287
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:35,439
Go home, Henk Rogers, and come back with
your Nintendo crew to make a real offer.

1288
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:46,867
Where were you today?

1289
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,077
Doesn't matter.

1290
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,871
We did it.

1291
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:54,499
Handheld rights and they're promising
worldwide video game rights too.

1292
01:12:57,336 --> 01:12:58,378
Get in.

1293
01:12:58,462 --> 01:12:59,755
-[door slams]
-[engine starts]

1294
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:00,839
[in Russian] Dzerzhinsky Square.

1295
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:06,261
[engine revving]

1296
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:09,014
[in English] You don't have your car?

1297
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:12,267
I don't want to be followed.

1298
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:27,908
When I was a boy, uh, my father was
professor at Moscow University.

1299
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:32,120
And in 1965, a colleague of his
was jailed for selling his book abroad.

1300
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,289
Just for selling his book?

1301
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:36,583
Yes.

1302
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:39,419
And my father signed, uh,
a letter of protest,

1303
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:41,964
which was the right thing to do.

1304
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,175
But the Soviet retribution was swift.

1305
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:51,306
He lost his professorship and was barred
from holding a real job ever again,

1306
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,641
and it ruined him.

1307
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,977
And it ruined my family.

1308
01:13:55,477 --> 01:14:00,649
And I promised myself that I would never
put my kids through that kind of hell.

1309
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,569
But they are doing it again, Henk.

1310
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:05,863
And this time, to me.

1311
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:09,700
-[shouting]
-[car approaching]

1312
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:15,122
-[brakes squeal]
-[engine turns off]

1313
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:17,749
Do you know what that building is?

1314
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:23,046
Well, you should, because they've been
watching your every move.

1315
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:27,467
Wait. That's--

1316
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:30,012
That's the member of the Communist Party
at Central Committee,

1317
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:32,764
one of the most powerful men in USSR.

1318
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,099
Speaking to his agent.

1319
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:36,059
[Henk] KGB?

1320
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:38,812
Sasha is KGB?

1321
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:41,440
But she's--

1322
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:43,942
Why?

1323
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,069
Because you are a threat.

1324
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:50,157
You represent everything our country
has fought against for 80 years.

1325
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:54,828
And he just found out
that ELORG promised you Tetris.

1326
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:58,081
[in Russian] Airport right away!

1327
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,583
[engine starts]

1328
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:05,255
[Maya singing in Japanese]

1329
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:08,550
[Henk] Tell them it's important.

1330
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:11,803
It's about Tetris. I'm laid over in Korea,
but only for an hour.

1331
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,264
Sorry, Mr. Rogers. They're in a meeting.

1332
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:15,474
Can I take a message?

1333
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:17,684
[Henk] Uh, no, uh--
I wanna tell them myself.

1334
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,269
I'll call when I'm home. Thanks.

1335
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:21,355
[singing continues]

1336
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:25,067
Gentlemen. Robert Maxwell,
Chairman of the Mirror Group. Pleasure.

Minoru Arakawa.

1338
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:29,738
This is Howard Lincoln,
my senior VP and chief legal counsel.

1339
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:31,365
How can we help you today, sir?

1340
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,992
[singing continues]

1341
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:36,453
I think I've got something you want.

1342
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:38,872
Kevin, are you there?

1343
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:40,207
Yes.

1344
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:41,834
It's good news, gentlemen.

1345
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:47,506
[audience applauding]

1346
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:56,640
[fax machine whirs, beeps]

1347
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:01,019
[Valentin, in Russian]
You see Nikolai Evgenievich…

1348
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:04,106
Unlike you, I put our country first.

1349
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:09,152
Don't hurt him too much.
He still has work to do.

1350
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:12,906

1352
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,414

1354
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:34,761

-Oh, no.
-[phone ringing]

[ringing continues]

1360
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,869
-Hello?
-Henk, it's Howard Lincoln.

1361
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:01,955
Listen, I thought I should call you
and tell you in person.

1362
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:03,665
I-- I don-- I don't, um--

1363
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,418
I'm sorry, you didn't get the, uh,
Game Boy rights for Tetris.

1364
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:07,753
We gotta go with Mirrorsoft.

1365
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:09,421
You understand, right?

1366
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,300
-Hello?
-They're lying, Howard. Everybody's lying.

1367
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:15,302
They're blackmailing me
so I keep my mouth shut.

1368
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:18,180
But I'm telling you, Mirrorsoft
doesn't even have the video game rights--

1369
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:22,351
Henk, relax. We just got a fax from ELORG
confirming Mirrorsoft's license.

1370
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:23,810
It's legit, okay?

1371
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:26,063
We'll find something else to work on.

1372
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,398
-[stammers] Wait, wait.
-[Howard] All right? Bye-bye.

[sighs]

1377
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:52,130
The Maxwells screwed me, Akemi.
They took everything.

1378
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:54,925
You missed your daughter's concert.

1379
01:17:57,427 --> 01:17:59,012
Did you hear what I just said?

1380
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,016
[in Japanese]
Did you hear what I just said?

1381
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,352
[in English] We've got nothing left.

1382
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,520
Nothing!

1383
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:09,731
It's over, and you're giving me shit
about missing a concert?

1384
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:12,860
M-- Maya! Sh--

1385

[in Japanese] You selfish prick

1386
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:20,367
[in English] Honey? [breathes shakily]

1387
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,660
It's fine.

1388
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:23,662
Everything is gonna be fine.

1389
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:27,666
Because if it isn't,
then we don't have handheld rights,

1390
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:29,209
and we don't have console rights.

1391
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:31,170
And Nintendo will sue us for fraud,

1392
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:34,381
and we'll lose the business,
and they'll probably take our house.

1393
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:37,426
And I am trying
to keep it together, Akemi, really I am.

1394
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:39,052
But I do not have a backup plan.

1395
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:40,137
[breathes shakily]

1396
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:45,851
I just-- I just need you to understand

1397
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:48,812
that I did this because
I am trying to build a life for us.

1398
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:52,774
We had a life.

1399
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:54,943
[sighs]

1400
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:03,911
[dog barking]

1401
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,630
[in Russian] Can I come in?

1402
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,926
I devoted my life to this country,

1403
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,844
the great idea of it.

1404
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:22,846
But…

1405
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:25,516
I can't do it…

1406
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:29,019
…This country doesn't exist any more.

1407
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:33,857
We're turning into a nation of thieves.

1408
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,865
Tetris is going to Mirrorsoft.

1409
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:46,203
And I will be removed from my position
at ELORG once the deal is signed.

1410
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:50,541
But you can still make this right.

1411
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,632
Get this to Henk Rogers.

1412
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:02,094
He'll know what to do.

1413
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:05,889

[both speaking Russian]

1415
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:35,544
Hi

1416
01:20:36,378 --> 01:20:37,212
Hi

1417
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:38,797
[gasps] Fire!

1418
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,474
[fax machine beeping]

1419
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:51,852
[fire alarm ringing]

1420
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:06,950
What are you doing back there?

1421
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,541
[fire alarm continues]

1422
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:20,631
[video game chirping]

1423
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:28,514

1426
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:04,299
[shredders whirring]

1427
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:06,552
[in English] Kevin, my boy. Okay, get out.

1428
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:07,845
What the hell is going on?

1429
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:09,429
Spring cleaning, is all.

1430
01:22:09,513 --> 01:22:13,684
Shredding redundant balance sheets
we had made for our auditors.

1431
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:15,936
How are you? Congratulations on Tetris.

1432
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:18,397
I need one million US dollars,
and accounting's saying we don't have it.

1433
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,608
-Why do you need a million dollars?
-Why do I… [clicks tongue] For Tetris.

1434
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:24,570
Son, we don't have to pay the Russians
anything.

1435
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:26,572
We're giving them the encyclopedias.

1436
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:29,533
No, no, no. It was a competitive bid,
and that's the deal I struck.

1437
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:32,494
The deal is,
I am friends with Mikhail Gorbachev.

1438
01:22:32,578 --> 01:22:34,454
Stop with your damn "we're friends" bit!

1439
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:36,164
The Soviet Union is about to implode.

1440
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:39,543
Everyone's snatching up what they can,
and Gorbachev can't do a thing about it!

1441
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,629
Calm down, Kevin. Don't have a hissy fit.
You're not a child.

1442
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:45,799
Then stop treating me like one.

1443
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:50,637
-We don't have the money, do we?
-Of course we do.

1444
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:52,222
-But it's tied up.
-Okay.

1445
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:54,683
-I'll call the bank. I'll get a loan.
-No. I wouldn't do that.

1446
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:56,476
Jesus Christ, Father.
You said we were fine.

1447
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,604
We are fine.

1448
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:03,233
Once we secure Tetris from the Russians
and sign with Nintendo,

1449
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:04,776
-we'll be in the black.
-Okay.

1450
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,738
But who's going to convince the Russians
to give us Tetris for no money?

1451
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:08,822
Leave it to me.

1452
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:10,115
Good job, Son.

1453
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,752
Let's sue the fuck out of them.
This is the lowest of the low.

1454
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:23,378
But that doesn't solve the problem.

1455
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:25,339
We can send a cease and desist.

1456
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:27,341
Sir. Excuse me, sir. You can't--

1457
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:29,635
-Sir, they're in a meeting.
-Well, this meeting is over.

1458
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,887
-[Howard] What the hell is he doing here?
-Read this.

1459
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,931
-Henk, we don't have time.
-Read it!

1460
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:39,978
{\an8}-What the fuck is that?
-[Howard] Atari stole our patent.

1461
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:43,398
{\an8}They hacked the NES, now manufacturing
and selling our cartridges.

1462
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:44,733
Guess what their first game is.

1463
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,528
-They do not have the rights.
-They do in America. I checked.

1464
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:49,321
-No, they don't.
-[Howard] What?

1465
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:50,864
Who the hell is "A"?

1466
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:52,491
Alexey Pajitnov.

1467
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,369
"Henk, ELORG and Mirrorsoft lie.

1468
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:57,746
No rights for Tetris granted.

1469
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:00,499
Come back and make offer ASAP."
What's he mean, "no rights?"

1470
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:02,501
You're looking at Mirrorsoft's contract,

1471
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,795
which is just a letter of intent
that expired yesterday.

1472
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:06,380
-[Howard] So handheld rights are--
-Available.

1473
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:07,923
-[Minoru] And video game?
-Available.

1474
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,341
-Worldwide.
-But that means--

1475
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:12,094
I don't have video game rights in Japan,
because Stein and Mirrorsoft

1476
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:14,596
never had the right to sell them to me,
or to these guys.

1477
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,849
Wait, you're telling me
Atari doesn't have Tetris in America?

1478
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:19,852
I'm telling you
Atari doesn't have Tetris anywhere.

1479
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:29,194
What makes you so sure
this Alexey character isn't lying?

1480
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:32,906
Because he's the only one
who stands to gain nothing from this.

1481
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:36,535
What do you need from us?

1482
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:40,622
I need you and your checkbooks
to get on a plane with me to Moscow ASAP.

1483
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:43,083
And tell nobody.

[in Russian] He's back.

1488
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:17,492
And he brought friends.

What are you doing?

1493
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:48,607
What is going on?

1494
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,070
Damn.

1495
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:58,408
Stop.

1496
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:00,077

What is this?

You're moving.

1500

Where? Why? This is my home!
This was my parents' home. You can't!

1501
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,215
What's going on?

1502
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:16,093
Your husband broke the law.

1503
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:19,972
I got a call to say the boys

We're studying gravity in school!
He's showing us an experiment.

1511
01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:46,123
That's right.

1512
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:47,332
An 'experiment'.

1513
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:52,171
Which one will fall faster? Quick!

1514
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,590
-Chair?
-Mmm, mmm.

1515
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:57,134
Ah, this is where gravity gets tricky.

1516
01:26:57,176 --> 01:26:59,761
The chair should fall faster
because it's heavier, right?

1517
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:00,762
Yes

1518
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:02,431
But it won't.

1519
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:03,432

gravity doesn't care

1523
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:16,153
if you're as light as a coin

1524
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:17,321
or as heavy as a…

1525
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:19,364
Boy.

1526
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,451
Everything falls at the same speed.

1527
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:24,578
[Nina speaks Russian]

1528
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:26,205

Henk Rogers is back because of you.

1530

Ruining your life was easy.

1531
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:48,894
Cross me again
and you will no longer exist.

1532
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,107
Just like your friend Henk.

1533

[footsteps approaching]

1536
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:14,795
[Henk, in English] Mr. Belikov.

1537
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:18,173
Are you okay?

1538
01:28:19,508 --> 01:28:21,802
Sorry for my tardiness.

1539
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:32,729
So, you want to see…
[clears throat] …new games.

1540
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:35,357
No. We're here for Tetris.

1541
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:42,197
But I already informed you via fax
that Tetris transaction is dead.

1542
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:44,199
Uh-huh.

1543
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:49,538
And I assume you gave Mirrorsoft
the same deal you gave me.

1544
01:28:49,621 --> 01:28:51,707
A week to make an offer
for Tetris handheld.

1545
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,833
Ha-- Have they?

1546
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:56,962
Didn't think so. Here. Here's our offer.

1547
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:02,050
For video game and handheld Tetris.
Worldwide.

1548
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:05,637
[Howard] The money's up-front. We'll cover
all marketing and manufacturing,

1549
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:10,642
and give you 50 cents per unit sold
on both handheld and video games.

1550
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:15,772
One dollar per unit sold.

1551
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:19,109
Great. Let's sign, and we can go home.

1552
01:29:19,193 --> 01:29:20,235
No.

1553
01:29:22,654 --> 01:29:25,699
[in Russian] Please listen, I'm
negotiating what's best for our country.

1554
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:30,579
Protection of the government's property
and decision making is our responsibility.

1555
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:37,836
[in English] He says ELORG needs night
to go over contract.

1556
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:39,838
It's protocol.

1557
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:43,675
She is correct.

1558
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:46,720
It is protocol.

1559
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:51,975
Good. Time to go, gentlemen.

1560
01:29:52,559 --> 01:29:54,311
I have another appointment.

1561
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:56,730
[footsteps departing]

1562
01:29:58,607 --> 01:30:00,651
Five million dollars?

1563
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:03,237
And where is your money, Mr. Maxwell?

1564
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,823
I am not going to match
five million fucking dollars.

1565
01:30:06,907 --> 01:30:08,116
[Valentin] And you don't have to.

1566
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:12,663
All you have to do is wire ELORG
the one million your son promised them.

1567
01:30:13,372 --> 01:30:14,998
Tetris is yours.

1568
01:30:15,707 --> 01:30:17,125
You have 24 hours.

1569
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:21,880
[in Russian] Why is it so important
that the Maxwells win?

1570
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:28,554
Isn't the offer with more money
better for the Soviet Union?

1571
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:29,888
[lighter clicks]

1572
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:37,938
I'll concern myself with the
fate of the Soviet Union.

1573
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:42,276
You go and do your job.

1574
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:46,280
Dismissed.

1575
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:52,911
[scoffs]

1576
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:59,418
-[Kevin, in English] Father! Father.
-Not right now.

1577
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:01,712
Nintendo just offered the Russians
five million dollars

1578
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:03,463
for worldwide video game
and handheld rights.

1579
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:05,757
-I already know. Jo.
-[Jo] Yes.

1580
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:06,842
Wait.

1581
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:10,012
Did you say they offered on handheld
and video game rights?

1582
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:11,096
-Yes.
-Impossible.

1583
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,390
We already have
worldwide video game rights.

1584
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:15,350
-We licensed them from--
-[Stein] Kevin!

1585
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:16,643
-You son of a bitch.
-[grunts]

1586

-[people gasp]
-You were in Moscow.

1587
01:31:18,604 --> 01:31:20,147
You made a deal behind my back.

1588
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:23,233
Got ELORG to change my contract,
cutting me out!

1589
01:31:23,317 --> 01:31:26,612
-Someone call security!
-And you, Robert,

1590
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:29,656
I found Tetris for you
and you pay me no royalties!

1591
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:33,952
And now, because of your greed,
the Russians erased us from the profits.

1592
01:31:34,036 --> 01:31:35,370
What are you talking about?

1593
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:39,625
They redefined the word "computer"
in my new contract, huh?

1594
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:42,794
Cutting me out of video games
so you can steal it!

1595
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:45,214
We didn't sign
any new video game contracts.

1597
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:49,927
Oh, you fucking fool!

1598
01:31:50,928 --> 01:31:52,638
I am a fucking fool?

1599
01:31:53,263 --> 01:31:55,307
The bratty son of a billionaire

1600
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:59,228
who's never done an honest day's work
in his life calls me a fool?

1601
01:31:59,311 --> 01:32:01,480

1604
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:09,571
Come on, mate. Get off! [grunts]

1605
01:32:09,655 --> 01:32:11,240
Off! Off me!

1606
01:32:11,323 --> 01:32:12,407
Off! Off!

1607

[screams, grunts]

1608
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:16,370
You, all of you,

1609
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:18,664
you're all working for thieves!

1610
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:19,790
Huh?

1611
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:21,250

1612
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:24,503
Jo, have the jet ready in an hour.

1613
01:32:25,087 --> 01:32:26,547
I'm going to Moscow.

-[dog barking]
-[shouting in distance]

1616
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:03,959
Mr. Maxwell. Welcome to--

1617
01:33:08,297 --> 01:33:09,882
Fucking you again?

1618
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:17,472
Ah, gentlemen, welcome.

1619
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:24,062
Apologies, but I am gaining weight
and need new suit for today's celebration.

1620
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:26,398
You look great, General Secretary.

1621
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:29,276
-[scoffs] And you are bad liar, my friend.
-[Maxwell laughs]

1622
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:30,903
How can I help you?

1623
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:33,447
Unfortunately, this isn't a social call.

1624
01:33:34,114 --> 01:33:38,368
My son and I are here because
there is an American businessman in Moscow

1625
01:33:38,452 --> 01:33:40,787
who's been manipulating your bureaucrats

1626
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:43,707
into giving him the rights
to a Russian video game

1627
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,752
that my company already had a deal on.

1628
01:33:47,336 --> 01:33:52,674
In fact, he's just offered your people
five million US dollars.

1629
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,301
And?

1630
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:58,263
And if this deal goes through,
it will set a dangerous precedent.

1631
01:33:58,347 --> 01:33:59,389
And what is that?

1632
01:34:00,766 --> 01:34:03,352
That communism is dead.

1633
01:34:09,107 --> 01:34:12,027
So, you are here to save my country?

1634
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:16,073
Once you let capitalists
through your gates, they will never leave.

1635
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:17,699
And what are you?

1636
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:20,911
As you said, I am your friend.

1637
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:25,165
We are proposing a fair trade
where no money is exchanged.

1638
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:29,378
You get the publishing rights
to our Collier's Encyclopedias,

1639
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:31,672
and we get the game.

1640
01:34:31,755 --> 01:34:33,465
An exchange of information.

1641
01:34:33,549 --> 01:34:38,720
I appreciate your benevolence, Robert,
but, uh, my country is broken.

1642
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:41,014
My people want freedom.

1643
01:34:41,098 --> 01:34:43,642
Freedom to vote, to choose their destiny.

1644
01:34:44,685 --> 01:34:48,564
Communism was never meant
to prevent freedom.

1645
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:51,859
But, unfortunately,
human greed got in the way.

1646
01:34:53,318 --> 01:34:58,574
The world is changing, gentlemen,
and Soviet Union will not be left behind.

1647
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:02,828
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have speech to prepare.

1648
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,332
Would you like my advice?

1649
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:12,129
Respectfully, Mr. Trifonov, we've got
this far without you, so do fuck off.

1650
01:35:13,797 --> 01:35:16,008
Just get me Tetris.

Get me everything you know on him.

No.

[singsongy] Told you I'd be back.

-You shouldn't have come.
-What?

1662
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:19,321
You're the reason I'm here.

1663
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:21,490
You misinterpreted me.

[scoffs]

1665
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:26,745
You literally said,
"Come back and make an offer ASAP."

1666
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:29,581
I was wrong. You don't deserve it.

1667
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:32,876
-Alexey, what's up? We're friends.
-We are not.

1668
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:35,587
You used me to get what you want.

That is-- How could you say that?

01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:39,842
I'm doing this for us.

1671

You are doing it for you.

1672
01:36:42,177 --> 01:36:44,680
I don't stand to profit a penny from this.

1673
01:36:44,763 --> 01:36:46,014
I'll make sure you do.
